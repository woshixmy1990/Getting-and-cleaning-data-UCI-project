UCI Project
The R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.




You should:
Download the UCI data sources to your local folder from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
that include both train data and also test data. 
Then run the run_analysis.R it will give you a tidy data that tells you the average of each variables for mean and std of each activity and each subject.
